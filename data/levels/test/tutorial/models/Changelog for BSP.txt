Changes for tutorial BSP:
Remove all portals (apart from +exactportal) as they do nothing but eat file size
Reduced Triangle count for player clipping
Reduced Triangle count for the two bases
Added a fake skybox (It's a bsp based skybox)
The stream Now has a realtime reflection
Better lighting due to increasing shader detail level
