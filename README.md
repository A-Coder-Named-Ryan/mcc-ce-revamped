# Halo CE - Revamped (MCC)
The "Revamped" tagset provides quality improvements, bug fixes and visual improvements for the tags and data
provided with the MCC Halo CE editing tools for use in the [Master Chief Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/).

This project aims to provide an updated drop-in replacement for the official HCEEK asset release.

This project sets out to make changes that should improve graphical fidelity of the game.
This project will also fix bugs that have accumulated during the various times the game has been
re-released, and to improve the quality of assets using the upstream provided source data.

Many fixes and improvements were sourced from [Halo CE - Revised (MCC)](https://github.com/Aerocatia/mcc-ce-revised)
