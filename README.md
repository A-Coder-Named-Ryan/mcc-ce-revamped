# Halo CE - Revised (MCC)
The "Revised" tagset provides quality improvements and bug fixes for the tags and data
provided with the MCC Halo CE editing tools for use in the [Master Chief Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/).

This project aims to provide an updated drop-in replacement for the official HCEEK asset release.

This project does not set out to make changes that affect the playstyle or atmosphere of the game.
Instead the goal is to fix bugs that have accumulated during the various times the game has been
re-released, and to improve the quality of assets using the upstream provided source data.
