# Halo CE - Refined (MCC)
Refined is a set of fixes and improveds to the base tagset of Halo: Combat Evolved as released in the [MCC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/).

This project does not set out to change the playstyle or atmosphere of the game -
instead this project aims fix explicit bugs and improve the quality of assets using
the upstream provided source data.

This can in turn be either played directly or used as a base for other custom maps.
